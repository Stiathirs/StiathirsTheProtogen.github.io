    <h1>StaithirsTheProtogen.github.io/Twine/Experiments</h1>
    Hello! This is where my Twine experiments live! You can find their source HTML files on the <a href="https://github.com/StiathirsTheProtogen/StiathirsTheProtogen.github.io">GitHub Repository</a>!<br>
    So far I only have one: <a href="Trapped/">Trapped</a>, which is a combination of multiple experiments:
    <ul>
      <li>Inventory System</li>
      <li>Popup Menus</li>
      <li>Puzzle Mechanics</li>
      <li>Unlocking Areas</li>
      <li>Text Input Processing</li>
      <li>Book Reading</li>
      <li>Certain text only appearing under certain Conditions</li>
      <li>Forced User Input</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Note: The story is awful, but it doesn't matter, as this was just a test of things!</h2>
