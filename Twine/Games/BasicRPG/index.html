    <h2>Welcome to <b>Basic RPG!</b></h2>
    <p><b>Basic RPG</b> is an RPG style grinding game where you beat monsters to become stronger!</p>
    <p>Do you get bored from grinding? Don't worry, this game makes it even more boring by having no graphics! But at least there's some different mechanics to make up for it I guess :P</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Kill monsters and level up to become stronger!</li>
      <li>Get gold and become rich!</li>
      <li>Die a horrible death I guess?</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>There is now a dedicated <a href="https://discord.gg/f6YEjFKchY">Discord Server</a> for the game!</h3>
    <h3>This game is in development, after an update, your save data may be wiped, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED</h3>
    <p>You can play the modern version <a href="Play/">here!</a></p>
    <p>Don't want to play with the modern combat system, you masochistic/lucky bastard? The legacy version of the game is <a href="Legacy/">here,</a> but it will no longer be updated.</p>

    <h2>Changelog</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>Continued Optimizations</h3>
    <h4>Fully optimized the shop, optimized the inventory, and optimized the rest screen.</h4>

    <h3>Optimization Update</h3>
    <h4>Stop spamming <b>(<i>live:</i> 1ms)</b> everywhere!</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Removed all <b>(<i>live:</i>)</b> macro usage in the Skills screen</li>
      <li>Reworked the shop to not bring you to a passage and back when buying health potions, and instead did it all on the shop passage</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Haven't figured out how to do that for the Trait Crystals yet, I'll figure that out some other time.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Event Hotfix: Fixed the decimal health bug</h3>
    <h4>I forgot the (round:) macro, making it possible to get decimal health. Oops!</h4>
    <br>
    <h3>MAJOR UPDATE - Achiever Update</h3>
    <h4>There's actually a reason to keep playing now!!</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Added achievements!</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li>You can find the achievements screen by clicking <b>Achievements</b> in town.
        <li>There's 22 achievements for you to earn, can you get them all?</li>
      </ul>
      <li><b>Saving and Loading</b></li>

      </ul>
      <li>Added a title screen</li>
      <li>Added a <i>lot</i> more INIT passages</li>
      <ul>

      </ul>
      <li>Moved INIT vars that don't change on roll result to a new passage, like I did the custom macro.</li>
      <li>You no longer start with gold</li>
      <ul>
        <li>This is both because I didn't know how it would work for the Statistics screen, and also so you can't just buy a Trait Crystal right off the bat, you should have to work for it.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <br>

        <li>You gain 10/20/30% more EXP</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Moved level up script to a custom macro, so I don't have to rewrite it every single time, and also make any changes to the level up event and apply it to every passage at once.</li>
      <ul>
