    <h2>Welcome to <b>Basic RPG!</b></h2>
    <p><b>Basic RPG</b> is an RPG style grinding game where you beat monsters to become stronger!</p>
    <p>Do you get bored from grinding? Don't worry, this game makes it even more boring by having no graphics! But at least there's some different mechanics to make up for it I guess :P</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Kill monsters and level up to become stronger!</li>
      <li>Get gold and become rich!</li>
      <li>Die a horrible death I guess?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can play the modern version <a href="Main/">here!</a></p>
    <p>Don't want to play with the modern combat system, you masochistic/lucky bastard? The legacy version of the game is <a href="Legacy/">here,</a> but it will no longer be updated.</p>
