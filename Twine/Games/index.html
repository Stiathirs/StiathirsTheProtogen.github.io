    Hello! This is where my Twine games live! You can find their source HTML files on the <a href="https://github.com/StiathirsTheProtogen/StiathirsTheProtogen.github.io">GitHub Repository</a>!<br>
    So far I only have one: <a href="BasicRPG/">Basic RPG</a>, which is an unfinished RPG style grinding game, with the following mechanics:
    <ul>
      <li>Stats to improve your character</li>
      <li>A semi-complete Inventory System</li>
      <li>An unfinished shop to buy Health Potions</li>
      <li>Encouragement to adventure longer with better rewards</li>
      <li>Monsters become more dangerous the longer you go</li>
      <li>EXP system to level up</li>
      <li>EXP requirement increases as you level up</li>
      <li>A time system (although not that in depth)</li>
      <li>Something special might happen if your HP reaches zero during an adventure?</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Note: I probably won't ever finish this game. Keyword: probably.</h2>
